# Final Project - Project Proposal (INFO 201 A)
**Group 11: Brittney Oeur, Elizabeth Williams, and Soha Sultana**

## Story Pitch:
The story our group intends to tell is about the relationship between tobacco use, employment status and/or education level, and mental health. Such as how the use of tobacco/smoking, the status of someoneâ€™s employment and/or education level may have an impact on their mental health.

We believe this an interesting and compelling story because it touches on a topic that affects a large portion of the population. In recent years, the awareness of mental health has risen tremendously, and advocating for people to seek professional help has been more accepted by mainstream culture. In addition, smoking is a widespread habit that affects the lives of millions of people, and its impact on mental health is often overlooked. By exploring this topic, we can shed light on the issues. Moreover, the impact of employment status and/or education level on smoking and mental health can highlight the larger issue of socioeconomic inequality. Within the context of the ongoing pandemic, the relationship between smoking and mental health has become even more pertinent. Stress and anxiety levels have been on the rise, which has led people to turn to smoking as a coping mechanism. This can then lead to an increased need for mental health support, especially for those in lower socioeconomic brackets who may have more limited resources.

Some of the data we plan to look at includes causes of smoking in young adults, and the rates of this over time and what treatment options have been presented across the country. These pieces of data are important to look at because it can show what issues are causing young adults to engage in these harmful behaviors, and is it because of the lack of mental health care that is causing this. Analyzing this data can help us understand the correlation between mental health issues and tobacco use. Another question that can be asked is how the rates of young adults using these products changed over time. This is another important question to think about because it can show what significant cultural and historical changes have affected the rate of mental health in young adults to turn to tobacco use. (Ex. COVID). Another question that is worth asking is how the different states responded to this crisis. This is important to look at, as it can give insight on what solutions are working to combat this issue and what areas are experiencing this problem at unprecedented levels. With this information, it can give lawmakers a general overview of this issue and make them aware of what solutions are working, by comparing the data from other states and seeing what solutions have worked and what have not.

Overall, this story is relevant and timely, given the pandemic and the extensive impact it has had on mental health. It is also a topic that affects a large portion of the population and is therefore of interest to many communities. By exploring the relationship between smoking, employment status, education level, and mental health, we can better understand the complex interplay between these factors.
